This is my first React project. I used it on the React module protection from the JS track at SoftUni University.
I named it "CarTrade".It is a website for buying / selling second hand cars.
To start server open terminal on vscode, then make sure you enter the server folder and execute 'node server.js' command, then to start client side open terminal on vscode, then make sure you enter the folder 'client' and type 'npm install' and then 'npm start'.
